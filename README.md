You can run the Sum it! website locally using [dev containers with VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers):

- Open the project in VS Code
- Click on the `Reopen in Container` button (or on the blue icon at the bottom left of the window)

In a VS Code terminal, run `gulp` to rebuild the bookmarklet code from `src/` and inject it in `index.md`.

Go to http://localhost:4000/ to preview the landing page (`index.md`).
